                    <h1>Building management frameworks for distrubuted systems using Python and SaltStack</h1>
                </section>
								<section data-markdown>
									## Who we are
									- Indian Open software based storage company

									- Based out of a non urban centre for certain philosophical reasons

									- Interests extend beyond storage/IT
								</section>
								<section data-markdown>
									## Our intentions in storage/IT
									- Build high performance storage stacks (software and hardware) that are affordable to all markets, not just the developed, leveraging opensource stacks.

									- Parallel file system based product

									- Single node unified storage product (Unified-NAS)
								</section>
								<section data-markdown>
											## About this presentation
											- Our experiences in building out a product based on a distributed file system (glusterfs)
								</section>
								<section data-markdown>
									## What we will cover
									- A brief description of our product

									- Why we needed a distributed management framework

									- A brief intro to saltstack

									- How we are using saltstack to address out need

									- Our experiences (joys and pain points)
								</section>
								<section data-markdown>
									## Disclaimers
									- No allegiance to salt stack

									- Purely our experiences

									- Not played around much with other stacks so no grounds to do in depth comparisons
								</section>
								<section data-markdown>
									## Our PFS based product
									- Hardware optimized for high performance, low power consumption. Soon moving to support any underlying hardware.

									- Based on open underlying software stacks - Linux, Centos, Gluster.

									- Use gluster to aggregate the storage on multiple nodes to present as one name space

									- Significantly simplified, unified, management framework to manage the whole system
								</section>
								<section data-markdown>
									##Why we need a distributed management framework
									- We deal with potentially a large number of systems

									- Need to configure all the systems from a single point

									- Need to moniter all the systems from a single point

									- Need to troubleshoot all the systems from a single point
								</section>
								<section data-markdown>
									## Our potential choices
									- Write our own underlying communication/management infrastructure. (Reinventing the wheel)

									- Choose an existing open source communication/management infrastructure. (much more robust and sustainable choice)
								</section>
								<section data-markdown>
									## What we need from the infrastructure

 									- Strong developer community

									- Python based (since we are python based)

									- High performance (since we potentially will be communicating with a large number of systems)

									- Open Source
								</section>
								<section data-markdown>
									## Why Saltstack

									- Answered all our needs :

										- Open source with an active developer community.

										- Python based

										- Based on zeromq - high performance, parallel operations
								</section>
								<section data-markdown>
									## What is Saltstack
									- A brief intro/history of Saltstack
								</section>
								<section data-markdown>
									## Saltstack model
									- Has a master/minions model

									- Can target all/subset of minions from the master

									- Salt keys (requested, accepted, deleted)
								</section>
								<section data-markdown>
									## Some networking prerequisites
									- All our nodes need initial IP/DNS configuration through their terminal

									- All the nodes are salt minions

									- Have 2 salt masters

									- All minions are preconfigured to point to the salt masters using a preset DNS name
								</section>
								<section data-markdown>
									## So how do we use SaltStack
									- When any node boots up after the initial configuration :

									- Communicate with the salt master

									- We know the list of pending minions.

									- Use this in the UI to add nodes into our monitored pool

									- Once they are part of the salt's acceped minion list, they can be monitored remotely.
								</section>
								<section>
									<section data-markdown>
									  ## Example - Creating a gluster distributed volume
								  </section>
									<section data-markdown>
									- Requires an understanding of gluster concepts

									- Using gluster manually, required admin to choose the location of data.

									- Since we know about all the nodes through salt, we distribute the volumes as widely as possible to maximize performance.

									- But volume creation has some prereuisites - needs gluster bricks to be places in zfs datasets
								</section>

								<section data-markdown>
									- We offer a choice of deduplicated, compressed or normal underlying storage into which the gluster bricks can be placed.

									- Based on the admin's choice, we use salt to first create datasets for the bricks with the appropriate properties on all the nodes.

									- What happens if this fails on any node?

									- We need to do a selective rollback - again using salt
								</section>
							</section>

								<section>
									<section data-markdown>
									  ## Example - Constant monitoring
								  </section>
									<section data-markdown>
										- Requires monitoring of many resources on each node to be collected and reported centrally.

										- We use custom saltstack modules to pull information from various sources - ipmi, hard disks (smart monitoring, etc), zfs status, network stats, cpu, memory, gluster, etc..

										- These scripts are run on a cron from the primary nodes to fetch json formatted status data.

										- Alerts are setup based on certain conditions triggered from  this status data.

										- Our web based monitoring framework then pulls this latest data whenever needed.

										- Salt also allows us to do things like pull logs from any node on demand.
								  </section>
								</section>
								<section data-markdown>
									## Distributed Test Framework
									- Automating FIO testing and result collection using SaltStack
								</section>
								<section data-markdown>
								## Many more examples
								- We use salt extensively for many more functionalities - dynamic DNS updates, handling disk failures, node flagging, services control, distributed samba control, etc..

								- Would have taken us a lot, lot longer to implement all this without the use of a platform like SaltStack
								</section>
								<section data-markdown>
									## We are open
									- We are just cleaning out our code

									- Watch https://github.com/fractalio for more updates.

									- Contributors welcome :-)
